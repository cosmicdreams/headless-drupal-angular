Headless Drupal + Web Components
=======================

A (currently not) working "Headless Drupal" example implementation based on Web Components, Polymer, and Drupal 8.

## See a demonstration online:
### http://dev-headless-drupal-8.gotpantheon.com/

This is a quick and dirty demo, intended as a starting place for discussion, and to help others get hacking quickly. There's a _lot_ of work TODO.
This work is based off a previous demonstration based on AngularJS and found here:
## http://dev-headless-drupal-8.gotpantheon.com/

Pull requests are welcome.

## Setup

1. Start with a fresh Drupal 8 instance. [Use Pantheon if you like](https://www.getpantheon.com/d8)
2. Enable all the HAL module (which will also install it's dependencies).
3. Clone this repo into the root of your Drupal 8 site ( git clone https://github.com/cosmicdreams/headless-drupal-angular.git )
4. Navigate the app folder with a command line tool and run: bower install
5. Visit index.html
6. ????
7. Profit!

## TODO:

- Get a demo working
- Notify Angular project of progress.
- Help documentation efforts
- Benchmark performance of approach
- Tell others and find out how to make it better
- Better packaging/documentation of how to configure Drupal.

## Developers
Switch to the develop branch for current work in progress, master will be updated when it's working.
